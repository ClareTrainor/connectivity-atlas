      <h1>Connectivity Atlas</h1>
	  <p>Infrastructure connects us and defines us. The roads and pipes and lines that deliver our services also shape our opportunites, our vulnerabilities, and our identity. While political and geographic maps abound, there are few useful, elegant maps of infrastructure. Frustratingly, finding data to contruct such a map is extremely difficult. Open data and maps about infrastructure are extremely difficult to find. This is surprising given the important role that infrastructure plays in our lives.</p>
    <p>The Connectivity Atlas attempts to address these gaps. With the Connectivity Atlas we invite you to explore the shapes and lines that shape our shared connectedness. We also invite you to download the data. All of the data on the site is open and available for reuse.

    <p>The Connectivety Atlas was inspired by conversations between Parag Khanna and Developement Seed. It is integrated into his upcoming book [Mapping the Future](link).
