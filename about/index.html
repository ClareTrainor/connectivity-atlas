      <h1>Connectivity Atlas</h1>
	  <p>Infrastructure connects us and defines us. The roads, pipes and cables that deliver our services also shape our opportunites, our vulnerabilities, and our identities. Political and geographic maps abound. There are few useful, elegant maps of the complex infrastructure that ties us. The Connectivity Atlas invites you to explore the shapes and lines that shape our shared connectedness. We believe that great insight lies in these maps.</p>
    <p>This is foremost a data project. It is frustratingly difficult to find usable geodata on infrastructure. This is surprising given the significant public resources that go toward building and maintaining this infrastructure and given the important role that infrastructure plays in our lives. All of the <a href="data/index.html">data on the Connectiviy Atlas</a> is open and available for reuse.</p>
    <p>The Connectivity Atlas was inspired by conversations between Parag Khanna and Developement Seed. Snapshots and insights from the Connectivity Atlas will be featured in Parag's upcoming book <em><a href="http://paragkhanna.com/">Mapping the Future</a></em>.</p>
